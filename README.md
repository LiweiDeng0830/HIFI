# HIFI Unsupervised Anomaly Detection for Multivariate Time Series with High-order Feature Interactions

## Usage
In the paper, three dataset **MSL**, **SMAP** and **SMD** are used. Due to the memery limit of Github, we only put some samples in <kbt>/data/ServiceMachineDataset<kbt> which is a subset of **SMD**.
